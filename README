JS_REST_rails (A plugin for a project that wants a better name).

For now, you'll have to look at the example app to see usage:
http://github.com/dies-el/js_rest_example

Problem:
It can be a right pain to make sure the UI stays in sync with the appication state once JS is more heavily used in your app.

Proposed solution:
Provide a simple way to create classes in JS that represent the models in your application and provide access to CRUD actions. Additionally provide a means to trigger code to run when your model is updated.

For more information (in the mean time) see:
